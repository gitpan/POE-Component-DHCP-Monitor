DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::DHCP::Monitor is a simple POE Component for monitoring
    DHCP traffic. It listens on a specified port ( defaults to 67, which
    usually requires administrative privilege ). Any DHCP broadcast traffic
    received will generate an event with a Net::DHCP::Packet object as the
    first argument. You may then query the objects methods to obtain salient
    information.

CONSTRUCTOR
    spawn
        Starts a new POE::Component::DHCP::Monitor session. If this is
        called from within another POE session then that session is
        automagically registered to receive events from the component. Other
        sessions will have to use the 'register' event listed below.

        Takes a number of arguments:

          'alias', an optional kernel alias to address the poco by;
          'address', set a particular IP address on a multi-homed box to bind to;
          'port', set a particular UDP port to listen on, default is 67;
          'port2', set a particular UDP port to listen on, default is 67;
          'options', pass a hashref of POE session options;
          'prefix', optional set the output event prefix, default is 'dhcp_monitor_';

METHODS
    These methods are available on the POE::Component::DHCP::Monitor object:

    session_id
        Returns the POE session ID of the poco's session.

    shutdown
        Terminates the poco, unregistering all registered sessions and
        closes the listening socket.

    getsockname
        Returns the packed sockaddr address of this end of the first socket
        connection.

    getsockname2
        Returns the packed sockaddr address of this end of the second socket
        connection.

INPUT EVENTS
    The component accepts the following events:

    register
        Takes no arguments. This registers your session with the component.
        The component will then send the registering session a 'registered'
        event. The session will forthwith receive applicable events from the
        component, until either the component is shutdown or the session
        unregisters.

    unregister
        Takes no arguments. This unregisters your session with the
        component. The unregistering session will receive an 'unregistered'
        event.

    shutdown
        Terminates the poco, unregistering all registered sessions and
        closes the listening socket.

OUTPUT EVENTS
    The component will send the following events:

    dhcp_monitor_socket
        Sent by the component to 'registered' sessions when the socket is
        successfully started. ARG0 will be the packed sockaddr address of
        the socket.

    dhcp_monitor_packet
        Sent by the component to 'registered' sessions when a DHCP packet is
        received and successfully parsed. ARG0 will be a Net::DHCP::Packet.
        ARG1 will be the port number this packet was received on.

    dhcp_monitor_registered
        Sent by the component to a registering session only on successful
        registration. ARG0 is the components object.

    dhcp_monitor_unregistered
        Sent by the component to an unregistering session only on successful
        unregistration.

    dhcp_monitor_sockbinderr
        Sent by the component to 'registered' sessions when an error occurs
        in setting up the listening socket. ARG0 is the error string. The
        component will shutdown automatically after such an error.

    dhcp_monitor_sockopterr
        Sent by the component to 'registered' sessions when an error occurs
        in setting the SOL_SOCKET and SO_BROADCAST options on the socket.
        ARG0 is the error string. The component will shutdown automatically
        after such an error.

    dhcp_monitor_sockrecverr
        Sent by the component to 'registered' sessions when an error occurs
        in reading a packet from the socket.

    dhcp_monitor_sockpackerr
        Sent by the component to 'registered' sessions when an error occurs
        in parsing a received packet using Net::DHCP::Packet.
